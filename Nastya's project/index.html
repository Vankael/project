            <h2>Martin Luther</h2>
            <p>Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany, into a middle-class family. His father, Hans Luther, was a miner who worked hard to provide a better future for his son. Wanting Martin to become a lawyer, his father enrolled him at the University of Erfurt, where he earned a master’s degree in 1505. However, Luther’s life changed dramatically that same year.
